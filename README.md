# Visual-Odometry-For-Position-Tracking

## Overview 

Visual Odometry is a crucial concept in Robotics Perception for estimating the trajectory of
the Robot (camera to be precise). The concepts involved in Visual Odometry are quite the same for SLAM which needless to say is an integral part of Perception.

This project aims to develop a visual odomtery pipleline for the postion tracking application.
